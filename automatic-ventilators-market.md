<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automatic ventilators market primarily comprises two types: positive pressure mechanical ventilation and negative pressure mechanical ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation actively pushes air into the lungs, commonly used in critical care settings and for patients with respiratory failure. In contrast, negative pressure ventilation creates a vacuum around the body, facilitating lung expansion and is often utilized in non-invasive settings, such as for patients with neuromuscular disorders. Both types play crucial roles in managing respiratory conditions and enhancing patient care.</p></p>
