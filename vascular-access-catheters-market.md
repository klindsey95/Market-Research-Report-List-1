<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Access Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-microbial Catheter</li><li>Non Anti-microbial Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular access catheters market is divided into two main types: anti-microbial catheters and non anti-microbial catheters. Anti-microbial catheters are designed with coatings or materials that help reduce the risk of infections, making them ideal for long-term use in patients with increased susceptibility to infections. Non anti-microbial catheters, while effective for vascular access, lack such protective features and may pose a higher risk of infection. Both types serve distinct needs within clinical settings, impacting patient outcomes and healthcare costs.</p></p>
