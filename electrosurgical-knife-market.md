<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Knife Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulation-Tipped (IT) Knives</li><li>Needle-Tipped Knives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgical knife market consists primarily of insulation-tipped (IT) knives and needle-tipped knives, each serving distinct surgical needs. IT knives feature a non-conductive coating, allowing precise cutting while minimizing adjacent tissue damage. They are widely used in delicate procedures requiring accuracy. In contrast, needle-tipped knives have a sharp, pointed tip, making them ideal for coagulation and cutting in tighter spaces. Both types leverage high-frequency electric currents to enhance surgical efficiency, reduce blood loss, and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
