<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Materials in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the dentistry market, suture materials are categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures, often made from materials like polylactic acid, dissolve naturally over time, eliminating the need for removal and reducing patient discomfort. They are commonly used for soft tissue surgeries. Non-absorbable sutures, typically made from silk, nylon, or polypropylene, provide long-term support and require surgical removal after healing. These sutures are ideal for procedures where prolonged tension or stability is needed, such as in periodontal treatments.</p></p>
